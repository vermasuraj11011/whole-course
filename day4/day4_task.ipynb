    "    * If a field is declared private, it cannot be accessed by anyone outside the class, thereby hiding the fields within the class.\n",
    "    * To read or modify the field, you have to use the getter and setter methods.\n",
    "    * With this feature, you can make a class read-only or write-only. For example, you may want the \"salary\" field of an Employee class to be write-only. No one should be able to read it, but anyone should be able to modify it.\n",
    "    * Encapsulation is also known as data hiding."
